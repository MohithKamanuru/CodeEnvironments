As one of the contributors, I expressed my views on the efficacy of conducting a daily stand-up meeting with the team. 
Personally, I believe that it is a highly beneficial practice as it provides an opportunity for the entire team to come together and discuss progress updates. Additionally, such meetings facilitate the sharing of information on the tasks completed by other team members, which enhances our overall understanding and knowledge.



This is Aruj Nayak. I am the moderator of the meeting. I oversee the meeting and ensure that we
are not deviating from the topic at the end. I finally give my opinions at the end of the 
stand up meeting.
