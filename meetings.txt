I had a technical interview with a fellow student as a part of my Homework assignment, apart from that I have completed designing a API for the project work.
Tomorrow I have meeting with a undergraduate regarding my Research work, I will be working on the presentation slides today.
Also, I have to complete my Software Engineering workshop today.
I have bit blocking sort of delay for 1 of my Machine learning assignments as I couldnt give much time for the same. I am planning to do that too today.


As one of the contributors, I expressed my views on the efficacy of conducting a daily stand-up meeting with the team. 
Personally, I believe that it is a highly beneficial practice as it provides an opportunity for the entire team to come together and discuss progress updates. Additionally, such meetings facilitate the sharing of information on the tasks completed by other team members, which enhances our overall understanding and knowledge.
